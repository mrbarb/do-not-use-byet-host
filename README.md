Hello! 
This a 100% fun project which I've started cause: 
(insert cool story here)
amyways ye, this is a quick lil tool which you can use to lookup your ip. 
I selfhost the ip getting server, (ip.shruub.eu.org, feel free to use it) I do not log there, and, as far as im concerend, github doesnt log either.
also, i took the github embed from https://github.com/Tarptaeya/repo-card,
all other code was made by myself (as far as I'm concerned (?)).
okay that's it, have a great day!
